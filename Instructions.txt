To develop an AI model to process your 10 photos and generate a 360° view model, you can follow these steps:

1. _Collect and preprocess images_: Collect the 10 photos taken from different sides (at least 5 meters apart) and preprocess them by resizing, normalizing, and possibly applying data augmentation techniques.

2. _Detect keypoints and features_: Use a feature detection algorithm (e.g., SIFT, ORB) to detect keypoints and extract features from each image.

3. _Match keypoints and features_: Match the keypoints and features across images using a feature matching algorithm (e.g., Brute-Force, FlannBased).

4. _Calculate essential matrix and homography_: Calculate the essential matrix and homography matrix for each image pair using the matched keypoints and features.

5. _Stitch images_: Use the homography matrices to stitch the images together into a single 360° view panorama.

6. _Refine and optimize_: Refine and optimize the panorama using techniques like seam blending, exposure compensation, and color correction.

7. _Train AI model_: Train a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, GAN) on your dataset to learn the stitching process and generate new 360° views from input images.

Some popular algorithms and tools for image stitching and 360° view creation include:
